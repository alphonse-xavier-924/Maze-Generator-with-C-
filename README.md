# Maze Generator
This project is a maze generation visualizer using the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library in C++.
It demonstrates maze creation with the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and visualizes it in a graphical window.

## Features
- Generates a maze using the DFS algorithm.
- Visualizes the maze in real-time using SFML.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler
- [SFML library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
